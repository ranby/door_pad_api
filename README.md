# door_pad_api
A `node.js` API to use with the `react.js` web app door_pad.

## Features ##
Offers routes for the following three main uses.
* Public transport departure times
* Current weather forecast
* Location of nearby rental cars

## How to use ##
The first thing you have to do in order to use the API is to edit the `secrets.js` file with your own private credentials.
See file to know exactly what credentials are needed. 

Right now the API is hard-coded with the locations and public transport stations that suits my needs. This may change in the future,
but in the meantime you have to edit the code in order to use the API yourself.
